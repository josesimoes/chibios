# Note: Async VFS for Sandboxes (SB stall problem)

Design discussion outcome, 2026-06-11. Addresses the main limitation of
the guest-side threading model: a blocking POSIX call stalls the whole
sandbox.

the DMA case described there).

## Background: the guest threading model

Multi-threading inside an SB is provided by a **sub-scheduler inside the
sandbox** (green threads over the single host thread), driven
preemptively by VRQs with `SB_VRQ_ALARM` as the tick. Host-side
multi-threading per SB was assessed and rejected as too costly: it
requires migrating per-SB state to per-thread (`u_psp`, VRQ targeting),
a concurrency audit and locking of the FD table and host services
(use-after-free class risks in the host), process-semantics lifetime and
fault policy, and it destroys the mid-syscall exclusion defense (guest
code unable to run while a syscall is in flight), promoting copy-in-once
to a baseline requirement for all buffers.

The sub-scheduler keeps every host-side invariant intact at near-zero
cost: a green-thread switch is a guest-mode register swap (no SVC, no
MPU traffic), the SB remains one schedulable entity with one priority
(composes with core binding), and all defenses in the isolation note
hold unchanged.

## The problem

POSIX is a synchronous ABI and the ChibiOS VFS is synchronous down
through the drivers. A guest `read()` on a slow medium parks the host
thread in the kernel, and with it **every** green thread in the sandbox
— the sub-scheduler cannot run because its carrier thread is blocked.
VIO does not have this problem (born async, VRQ completion); VFS is the
synchronous holdout precisely because it is exposed as POSIX.

## Design: async host ABI, synchronous guest semantics

Keep POSIX as the guest-visible semantics; make the host ABI
asynchronous underneath; reconstruct the blocking illusion **per green
thread** in the guest runtime. Block the green thread, never the
carrier.

### Host side: submit / complete

- The syscall becomes **submit**: validate, enqueue, return immediately.
  The dispatcher never blocks; the syscall path gets *faster* than
  today.
- The blocking VFS call is executed by a **host worker thread** on the
  SB's behalf (rewriting the VFS/driver stack to be natively async is
  out of scope; the worker adapts the sync stack to the async boundary
  at minimal cost).
- **Completion is a VRQ**: one I/O-completion VRQ plus per-slot status,
  using the VRQ flags mechanism (`sbVRQSetFlagsI` is documented as "a
  fast way to transmit a (virtual) peripheral status" — this is exactly
  that). A small submission-slot table per SB lives next to
  `vfs_nodes[]` in `sb_ioblock_t`; slot count is the natural quota for
  in-flight operations per SB.
- VFS becomes, in effect, another virtual peripheral, unifying its model
  with VIO.

### Submission as an IRQ-like fastcall

With the IRQ-like fastcall design
([note_svc_mpu_optimizations.md](note_svc_mpu_optimizations.md) point 5),
submit does not even need to be a syscall: validate the slot, range-check
the buffer, copy the metadata, enqueue, `chThdResumeI(worker)` — exactly
ISR-shaped, never blocks, single exception. Status reads and cancellation
are trivial fastcalls too (cancel = I-class flag set + worker poke). The
hot I/O path then never enters the privileged dispatcher at all:
**fastcall = submit/status/cancel, worker = execution, VRQ = completion**.

- **Priority interplay gives both service models for free**: worker above
  the SB thread -> submit preempts into the worker immediately (doorbell
  with synchronous service); worker at the SB's priority (the default
  above) -> the guest keeps running, submits several slots, the worker
  drains when the SB yields or blocks — batching emerges naturally with
  no batching API. A per-SB tuning knob, not a design decision.
- **Backpressure**: slot table full -> the submit fastcall returns a
  try-again status immediately (I-class never blocks); the guest runtime
  yields on the completion VRQ.
- **Bounded copy-in caveat**: the control-plane copy happens inside the
  fastcall handler at SVC priority, so it must be small and bounded. For
  `read`/`write` it is nothing (pointer + length validation; data plane
  is DMA-semantics). For `open` the pathname copy is the cost — bounded
  by a config max (64-128 bytes, ~100 cycles) it is acceptable;
  otherwise path-heavy operations stay on the syscall path.

### Guest side

Libc wrappers keep the POSIX face: submit, yield to the sub-scheduler,
resume on the completion VRQ, return the status. Synchronous per green
thread; the SB never stalls. The only place the host thread legitimately
parks is `vrq_wait` when the whole guest is idle.

### Migration

The synchronous POSIX syscalls stay for compatibility. The async
submit/complete ABI is added alongside; guests opt in via their runtime.
The sync path remains appropriate for trivial/fast operations where a
stall is irrelevant.

## Security analysis

### The worker is a software DMA engine on guest memory

Once an operation runs concurrently with guest code, the mid-syscall
exclusion defense does not cover it: this is the "region writable by
both the sandbox and a peripheral/DMA engine" TOCTOU case of the
isolation note's margin 1, created in software. The discipline splits
cleanly:

- **Control plane — copy-in at submit, mandatory.** Pathnames and all
  metadata: `sb_check_string` / range checks, then a private privileged
  copy; the worker never re-reads guest memory for metadata. This is the
  copy-in-once contract applied at the submit boundary.
- **Data plane — DMA semantics.** Read/write buffers are range-validated
  at submit and then treated like a hardware DMA target: a guest that
  mutates its own buffer mid-operation corrupts its own data, with no
  host exposure. Identical semantics to real DMA; no copy needed for
  bulk data.

### Teardown with operations in flight

The worker is one of the non-VIO producers covered by
[note_sb_lifecycle.md](note_sb_lifecycle.md). Sandbox termination enters
`STOPPING`, which rejects completion VRQs, and restart is prohibited until
the host has cancelled pending operations, stopped and joined the worker,
and acknowledged producer quiescence through `sbFinalize()`. This avoids
requiring generation-aware completion callbacks.

The worker holds private copies of all metadata, but it may still access SB
memory for the final data copy-out or status write. That access must finish
before dynamic sandbox memory is released. An operation may be detached only
if it completes entirely into private discarded storage, retains no sandbox
or guest-memory reference, and cannot post a completion. Otherwise it must
be cancelled and joined before finalization.

### Worker topology: per-SB, not a shared pool

A shared worker pool creates **cross-SB head-of-line blocking**: one
sandbox's slow SD read delays another sandbox's I/O — a QoS/interference
channel between supposedly isolated guests, and a DoS lever (a malicious
SB saturating the pool with slow operations). With few SBs per system:

- **One worker per SB** (decision): timing isolation between SBs,
  trivial accounting, priority inheritance from the SB thread is
  well-defined. Total cost: one host thread + privileged stack per SB —
  a fixed, bounded cost, far below the per-guest-thread bill that made
  host-side multi-threading too costly.
- Fallback if even that is too much: a pool with strict per-SB queue
  limits, with the interference channel accepted and documented.

The worker inherits the SB thread's priority (avoids inversion against
other SBs' workers and host threads).

## Open items

- Define the submission-slot ABI (slot table layout, status codes,
  cancellation semantics) and which VFS operations get async variants
  first (`read`/`write` on block-backed files are the offenders;
  `open` involves path resolution and can also be slow).
- Decide the one-in-flight-per-FD question (simplest: yes, reject
  overlapping ops on the same descriptor).
- Specify worker cancellation/join semantics and their ordering with
  `sbFinalize()` and dynamic sandbox-memory release. In-flight slots must be
  cancelled, or detached without retaining any sandbox reference, before
  finalization permits the new instance to start.
- Guest runtime: green-thread wait/wake integration with the completion
  VRQ, and the idle policy (`vrq_wait`).
